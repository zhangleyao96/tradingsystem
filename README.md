# tradingsystem
The trading system deals with prices, trades, marketdata and inquiries. To generate the data, you need to run the PriceInput.cpp marketdataInput.cpp InquiryInput.cpp TradeInput.cpp seperately in their own projects. and you need to uncomment the commented part in main() function and comment all other part in main() function. To compile the system, you need to complie the tradingsystem.cpp. If you run sln then it will be simple. To compile the Input project, you need compile PriceInput.cpp marketdataInput.cpp InquiryInput.cpp TradeInput.cpp seperately. And everything should be like the files here. To run the system, make sure the input txt files are in the same directory and then RUN THE 4 INPUT PROGRAMS FIRST, then run the trading system program. To make things easy, you can also run the exe files(IN THE DEBUG FILE). Also first run the 4 input programs, then run the trading system program. Then you can check the output files.
